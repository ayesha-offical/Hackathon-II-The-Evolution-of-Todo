# Specification Quality Checklist: Todo In-Memory Python Console App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

✅ **PASSED**: Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

All checklist items have been verified:
- 5 user stories defined with clear priorities (P1, P2)
- 9 functional requirements fully specified
- 5 measurable success criteria defined
- 6 edge cases identified
- Acceptance scenarios provided for all user stories
- Coverage targets and testing requirements clearly defined
- No ambiguities or clarification markers remain

## Notes

Specification includes:
- P1 priorities: Add Task (FR-001), List Tasks (FR-003), Mark Complete (FR-004)
- P2 priorities: Update Task (FR-005), Delete Task (FR-006)
- All features independently testable and valuable
- Clear success metrics tied to user experience
- 80% minimum code coverage target aligned with Constitution Principle VII
